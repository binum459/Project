If its done, the skewer will come out clean.\n NOW FOR THE CAKE:.\n Mix the dry ingredients in a bowl.\n Mix the wet ingredients together well and add to the dry ingredients. Mix together until totally combined and smooth.\n Put the batter into your prepared pan(s) and bake according to the above directions:.\n FOR THE CREAM CHEESE ICING:.\n In a deep narrow bowl beat the cream cheese, margarine, vanilla and sea salt together well until it is a creamy mixture.\n Add the cocoa and mix thoroughly.

I prefer mine somewhat stiff, but its up to you.\n Once the cake(s) are totally cooled ice them and put into the fridge to set up for about 1 hour.\nCut yourself a big slice and enjoy with your favourite beverage.\n Bon Appetit!"
