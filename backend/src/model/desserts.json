    "ingredient":"3 cups flour (spelt)\n 2 cups sugar (natural)\n 2 teaspoons baking soda\n1 cup cocoa powder\n1 teaspoon sea salt\n2 egg substitute (i used ground flax seed and water) \n 1 cup soymilk \n 3/4 cup light oil \n 2 teaspoons vanilla extract (i used maple) \n 1 cup boiling water \n 8 ounces cream cheese (sofened-i used toffuti) \n 1/4 cup margarine (softened-i used earth balance) \n 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract \n 1/8 teaspoon sea salt \n 3/4 cup cocoa \n 3 3/4 cups powdered sugar",
    "instruction":"PRE-PREPARATIONS:.\n Preheat your oven to 350F.\n Prepare your baking pan(s). Make sure you grease them well and put parchment on the bottom of the pans. This cake can stick.\n You can use a tub pan. If you do, bake this for one hour.\n You can use a 9 x 13 rectangular pan, if you do bake for 45 minutes.\n If you use 2 round 8 cake pans bake for 30-35 minutes.\n Not all ovens are the same so cooking times may vary slightly.\n After the cake is done, check it with a skewer by sticking it in the middle of the cake. If its done, the skewer will come out clean.\n NOW FOR THE CAKE:.\n Mix the dry ingredients in a bowl.\n Mix the wet ingredients together well and add to the dry ingredients. Mix together until totally combined and smooth.\n Put the batter into your prepared pan(s) and bake according to the above directions:.\n FOR THE CREAM CHEESE ICING:.\n In a deep narrow bowl beat the cream cheese, margarine, vanilla and sea salt together well until it is a creamy mixture.\n Add the cocoa and mix thoroughly. You could leave the cocoa out if you want a white icing.\n Add the powdered sugar until the icing is the consistency you like. I prefer mine somewhat stiff, but its up to you.\n Once the cake(s) are totally cooled ice them and put into the fridge to set up for about 1 hour.\nCut yourself a big slice and enjoy with your favourite beverage.\n Bon Appetit!"
